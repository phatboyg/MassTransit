Prerequisites
=============

MassTransit is a .Net framework for C# and will need a .Net runtime to run on.

To work with MassTransit you will need to be running on a Windows operating
system. The developers of MassTransit regulary test on Windows 7 and
Windows Server 2008RC2. Though it should still work on Windows Server 2003, as
long as .Net 3.5 sp1 is installed.

.. note::

    People are starting to run MassTransit with RabbitMQ on Mono with success.

.Net Framework
""""""""""""""

Currently MassTransit is tested on .Net 3.5 sp1 and .Net 4.0.

Transport Choices

MassTransit sits on top of a communication layer like MSMQ, or RabbitMQ. So you
will need to have one of those installed. We currently support:
