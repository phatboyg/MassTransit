	/// <summary>
	/// 
	/// So here is the deal
	/// The saga is a class that contains the state and behavior of the saga
	/// for messages that are saga messages. If the message is not a saga message
	/// it doesn't need any details about the saga in order to proceed.
	/// 
	/// This will allow services that are not saga-specific to participate in a saga
	/// 
	/// So something like an e-mail sender would send an e-mail, publish the mail sent message
	/// and that would trigger the saga to continue according to the result.
	/// 
	/// By doing so, the saga can then return to power after being away for a while.
	///
